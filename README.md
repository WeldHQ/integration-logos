# How to use

- Run `npm install`
- Add a new folder with the name of your integrations in: `/integrations`
- Add your logo (svg preferred) to the folder and name it after your integration
- Run `npm run build` and it should generate
- Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see how the file looks
- When you have merged your PR. Add a tag to the github repo - which will be used to reference the new version where you want to use this integration package.
- You can add a tag by: `git tag 0.1.14` and then `git push origin tag 0.1.14`
